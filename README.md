### Update May 18th 2017
We are currently rebuilding the database after realizing there was a better way to store the data; this will set us back a little bit however the finished product will be of a much more superior quality and allow the database to store much more data than it otherwise might be able to.

# FAQ:
#### When Will The Project Be Finished?
I'll be honest, we're far behind schedule; I wanted to have an alpha version ready by now. However, we are not giving up on this project. Once we finalize the database design (which we are close to doing now) we should be able to quickly deploy it without too many complications.

#### What Facial Recognition Software Will You Be Using?
The facial recognition software; while integral, is not the most important part of the project. The program will ship with OpenBMR (made by the same who created OpenCV), however, because of the modular way we're programming  it will be very easy to port it to any other software you have on hand or prefer.

#### How Do You Plan On Distributing The Database?
Each user will have their own database on their computer. The 'distribution' will come in the form of Blockchain technology; via the blockchain you will be able to:
* Subscribe To All Updates And Import Automatically
* Subscribe To User-selected Updates And Import Automatically
* Publish your database, automatically or manually
* Allow others to append to your database as you please
* Encrypt your database to prevent prying eyes from getting their hands on your data
* Selectively Allow/Disallow others to even receive your database (requires running a node)
We are also looking into the possibility of a voting system to gauge the trustworthiness of database contributors

#### Minimum Specs?
* OS: Linux 64bit
* Processor: Intel Celeron N3050  @ 1.60GHz
* Memory: 1GB RAM

You'll be fine with any modern laptop running Linux. Graphics cards may increase efficiency of bulk facial recognition (e.g. during very large imports), but most people work on a single perp at a time.
